# Requirements
## Introduction
 
I have some Hospital data that are present in excel sheets. So requirement is to make a program in which the user finds a particular data that are present in the sheets and it will be displayed in another Master Sheet.

 

## Research

Here I'm using Python 3 methods to work with Excel Sheets to find the particular data that are available on five different sheets and Print in to the another Master Sheet.

## Defining Our System
    1. Patient ID
    2. Patient Name
    3. Patient Mobile Number
    4. Patient's Age
    5. Patient's Weight
